Whereas in most cities the terms are interchangeable, in Amsterdam, there's definitely a distinction between a \u201ccoffee shop\u201d & a \u201ccafe.\u201d The importance of this distinction depends entirely on your mood, sense of adventure, & probationary status.  All Amsterdamers have stories of visitors naively announcing - \u201cWhere are these weed shops? Let's toke some green!\u201d Nobody sounds cool saying \u201ctoke some green,\u201d & it\u2019s in these situations when Amsterdamers are forced to flip the big kill-switch known as \u201cProject De-escalation: Keep Uncle Steve Away From The Weed.\u201d Step 1 involves a long bike ride followed by trips to brewery\/tasting rooms like Borouwer'ij (@brouwerijtij) or Butcher's Tears. If you can sneak in a few rounds of bitterballen with the heavy beers, it\u2019s likely your charge will forget their boastful weed promises.  If Step 1 doesn\u2019t work, Step 2 suggests a visit to a mellow coffee shop & slyly ordering - \u201cMag ik je zwakste weed? I have an idiot tourist who doesn't need anything stronger than hash cut with a ton of rolling tobacco.\u201d Once in hand, take your visitor on a walk to smoke & see the city. They\u2019ll last 30-45 minutes before crashing back at the hotel\/AirBnb\/your extra bedroom. Easy peasy!  The worst situation is when the visitor stays energetic through the bike ride, dubbels, bitterballen, & your kind offer to order weed. If they say \u201cIt's cool, dude. I\u2019ve smoked a lot of weed, I know the score,\u201d the only option is traditional Dutch directness. \u201cNo, Uncle Steve, you don't know the score. In fact, the score has been hydroponically mutated to such levels that you're going to end up wobbling down Leidsestraat wearing a knit Amsterdam beanie and asking strangers for the \u2018Hanses Blinkers Hotel.\u2019 I don't want to be on a cold bench listening to you repeatedly slur 'I might puke,' while my actual friends have normal evenings. But, hey, you get to go back to Rochester or Atlanta or Fort Worth & tell everyone about the time you were \u2018in Amsterdam looking for coffee and ended up at a coffee shop.\u2019\u201d Find the best coffee & coziest cafes in Amsterdam on Sightseen.","locationName":"Back to Black","createdTime":1460471334,"locationId":"305903991","coordinate":{"lat":"52.3609402961","lon":"4.88827599861"}}},{"_index":"instagram","_type":"post","_id":"AVtFQyU2GSUdCZJM09GU","_score":3.308868,"_source":{"food":["bitterballen","croquettes"],"text":"Typical Dutch #barsnacks -  #bitterballen aka #meatball #croquettes.  #travel #explore #foodblog #foodie #vacation #visiting #instatravel #instago #instagood #trip  #holiday #fun #travelfood  #travelblog #local #instatraveling  #travelgram #travelingram #expat #europe #dutchfood #amsterdamfood #amsterdam #thenetherlands #dutch #amsterdamfoodie","locationName":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","createdTime":1462293090,"locationId":"116231","coordinate":{"lat":"52.3731","lon":"4.8922"}}},{"_index":"instagram","_type":"post","_id":"AVtFQyoXGSUdCZJM09KH","_score":3.308868,"_source":{"food":["wine","bitterballen"],"text":"Time for a little wine and snack.
